Working title for a small CRUD application to pair foods and beer styles.

Backend: Flask (Python)

Frontend: React.js

Database: Graph Database 

Why?: I want to map some dozen beer styles to an (theoretically) "infinite" number of foodstuffs. For now in three categories: cooked food/main dish, cheese, dessert.
