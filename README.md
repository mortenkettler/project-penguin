Working title for a small CRUD application to pair foods and beer styles.

Backend: Flask (Python)

Frontend: React.js

Database: Graph Database 

Why?: I want to map some dozen beer styles to an (theoretically) "infinite" number of foodstuffs. For now in three categories: cooked food/main dish, cheese, dessert. 
A Graph Database models data as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), great for many-to-many relationships. Test locally with Neo4j, alternatives for AWS and Azure are Neptune and Cosmos DB, respectively.
