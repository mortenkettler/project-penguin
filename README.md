# project-penguin

Working title for a small CRUD application to pair foods and beer styles.

Backend: Flask (Python)
Frontend: React (Typescript?)

Flask: lightweight web framework that simplifies  building APIs with minimal setup. Alternatives:
Django: More feature-rich and opinionated, for large, complex applications.
FastAPI: Performance-focused, modern, and ideal for API-heavy applications.
Would be fun to test FastAPI as well.

Flask-smorest provides automatic OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation, input validation using Marshmallow, and modular API blueprints. Helps with API development through interactive documentation and enforcing data validation.
Tested Flasgger and it sucked.

Marshmallow is used for object serialization and deserialization, as well as data validation.
